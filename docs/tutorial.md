# Tutorial

After you've read the 1-Minute-Tutorial in the README, you can already nicely install and update deployables.
But the deployer can do more, and this tutorial will show you how to configure resources,
how to combine them into bundles, and how to integrate it all into a CI or even CD pipeline.

'Resources' are all the things that the deployer can change, e.g. deployables (`war` files, etc.) as well as loggers, etc.


## GET Plan

Before we start, you can also _read_ the currently effective configuration by simply GETting `http://localhost:8080/deployer`.
This resource provides a concise overview of the relevant configuration without providing confidential data like passwords
(it may still not be wise to make this information freely available in the internet).

You can GET this data as `application/yaml`, `application/json`, or `text/html`,
i.e. you can view it as simple tables with your browser.
Note that this is very simplistic and some information may be missing.

(currently `application/xml` does not work... but xml seems out-of-fashion anyway ;-)


## Undeploy & Manage & Pin

Every resource has an implicit parameter `state` set to `deployed`.
You can set it explicitly to `undeployed` to have that resource removed.
This is how to get rid again of, e.g., an application.


But how long are you going to keep those undeployed resources in your plans?
When is it safe to remove that cruft?
How do you make sure that a node freshly set up looks exactly as a node that's been running for years?
Manually keeping track of this all is not very infrastructure-as-code-ish.

So you can tell the deployer to [manage](reference.md#manage) a specific type of resource.
This makes the deployer _remove_ all resources that are _not_ listed.

To do so, add the following snippet to a file `deployer.config.yaml`:

```yaml
managed:
- deployables
```


Sometimes you'll have resources that are managed in a different way (The Deployer itself could be).
To always leave them as they are, you can [pin](reference.md#pin) them in your config, i.e.:

```yaml
pinned:
  deployables: [myapp]
```

They won't get removed when the resource type is managed, and you can't change them in any of your bundle files.
They also won't show up when reading the effective plan.


See the section [config](reference.md#config) in the reference for details.


## Configuring Resources

The deployer can be used to configure more than just deployables.
Here, we'll only scratch on the subject and just configure simple loggers and log-handlers, to build on that and combine things.
For the full details, please refer to the [reference](reference.md).

If you have several applications running in one container,
you'll want to have the logs for every app in a separate file and not everything clumped into the `server.log`.
To define a log-handler for `myapp`, simply add this to your `deployer.root.bundle`:

```yaml
log-handlers:
  MYAPP:
    file: myapp.log
```

See the section [loggers](reference.md#loggers) in the reference for more details.


To define a logger (a.k.a. category) for `com.mycompany.myapp` to log to this file, simply add this:

```yaml
loggers:
  com.mycompany.myapp
    level: DEBUG
    handler: MYAPP
```

See the section [log-handlers](reference.md#log-handlers) in the reference for more details.


## Audit

To plainly see who applied which changes in a separate json file, you can configure things like this:

```yaml
log-handlers:
  DEPLOYER:
    file: deployer.log
    format: "%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss,SSS}|%X{version}|%X{client}|%t|%X{reference}|%c|%p|%s%e%n"
  DEPLOYER-AUDIT:
    file: deployer-audit.log
    format: "{%X{json}}%n"

loggers:
  com.github.t1.deployer:
    level: DEBUG
    handlers:
    - DEPLOYER
    - CONSOLE
  com.github.t1.deployer.app.Audits:
    level: DEBUG
    use-parent-handlers: true
    handlers:
    - DEPLOYER-AUDIT
```


## Bundles

Now that you know about the building blocks, you should start to actually use them.
Do it for maybe two or three deployables and their loggers, then come back.
Yeah: Take a break from reading this tutorial. Do it for real. Now!

Welcome back! You now have a `deployer.root.bundle` that looks somewhat similar to this:

```yaml
log-handlers:
  MYAPP1:
    file: myapp1.log
  MYAPP2:
    file: myapp2.log
loggers:
  org.mygroup.myapp1:
    level: DEBUG
    handler: MYAPP1
  org.mygroup.myapp2:
    level: DEBUG
    handler: MYAPP2
deployables:
  myapp1:
    group-id: org.mygroup
    version: 1.0
  myapp2:
    group-id: org.mygroup
    version: 2.0
```

Note that you don't have to specify an `artifact-id` if it's the same as the `name` of the `deployable`.

Also note that the `version` can be a `-SNAPSHOT` version;
The Deployer will resolve it to the latest of those snapshots in the repository.

Even with only two apps, you'll notice that it's not easy to find all the things belonging to one app.
They are spread over all the resource types.
And this will be getting worse as you add more and more apps and more and more resource types.
The Deployer was designed to keep the resource types together, not the applications they belong to.

To take an app centric view, you can group things into so called bundles.
You already know how bundles look: The `deployer.root.bundle` is one.
So let's define one bundle for each app above:

#### `myapp1.bundle`

```yaml
log-handlers:
  MYAPP1:
    file: myapp1.log
loggers:
  org.mygroup.myapp1:
    level: DEBUG
    handler: MYAPP1
deployables:
  myapp1:
    group-id: org.mygroup
    version: 1.0
```

#### `myapp2.bundle`

```yaml
log-handlers:
  MYAPP2:
    file: myapp2.log
loggers:
  org.mygroup.myapp2:
    level: DEBUG
    handler: MYAPP2
deployables:
  myapp2:
    group-id: org.mygroup
    version: 2.0
```

If these were in the repository, we could include them in the root bundle as seen before:

#### `deployer.root.bundle`

```yaml
bundles:
  myapp1:
    group-id: org.mygroup
    version: 1.0
  myapp2:
    group-id: org.mygroup
    version: 2.0
```

Note that:

- The `version` of the bundles is "coincidentally" the `version` of the applications within.
- The `group-id` of the bundles is "coincidentally" the `group-id` of the applications within.

So let's get those bundles into the repository:

## Packaging Bundles

There are actually many ways to package bundles, and it's is actually completely outside of The Deployer itself,
but it's such an important step, so we'll describe one way briefly here.
We _could_ deploy these files with the GUI of the repository, or with a Maven command similar to this:

```bash
mvn deploy:deploy-file -DgroupId=org.mygroup -DartifactId=myapp1 -Dversion=1.0 -Dtype=bundle
-Durl=http://localhost:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local/org/mygroup/myapp1/1.0/myapp1-1.0.bundle
-Dfile=myapp1.bundle
```

But we'd rather deploy artifacts _automatically_.
So we'll build the bundles with the `build-helper-maven-plugin`:

- Create your project directory
- Create a sub folder `src/main/resources`
- Put your `myapp1.bundle` file in there.
- And finally add a `pom.xml` like this:

```xml
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <groupId>org.mygroup</groupId>
    <artifactId>myapp1.bundle</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>

    <properties>
        <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
        <project.reporting.outputEncoding>UTF-8</project.reporting.outputEncoding>
    </properties>

    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
                <artifactId>build-helper-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>1.12</version>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <id>attach-artifacts</id>
                        <phase>package</phase>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>attach-artifact</goal>
                        </goals>
                        <configuration>
                            <artifacts>
                                <artifact>
                                    <file>target/classes/${project.artifactId}</file>
                                    <type>bundle</type>
                                </artifact>
                            </artifacts>
                        </configuration>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
```

You may also need a `distribution-management` section. Then you can `mvn clean deploy` your bundle.

After you did this for `myapp1` and `myapp2`, you can make the change to the `deployer.root.bundle` described above.
Your apps should now get deployed and all the logging be configured.

## Variables

Nice and well, but there's no much use to it all, if you still have to copy the `deployer.root.bundle` to all of your machines by hand!
And every time you have to update a version, you'd have to repeat that process. Suboptimal.
We'd like to be able to update an application from the _outside_, e.g. from a Jenkins job.

To do that, simply set the `version` of `myapp1` to `${myapp1.version}`.
Then, using [httpie](http://httpie.org/), you can do:

```bash
    http --json POST :8080/deployer myapp1.version=1.0
```

... or (more wordy) using CURL:

```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"myapp1.version":"1.0"}' http://localhost:8080/deployer
```

But we have _two_ artifacts. If we replace the second version `2.0` with `${myapp2.version}`,
how should the build job of `myapp1` know about the version of `myapp2`?
Why should it even care about the existence of `myapp2` at all?

Easy: Just don't. The default `version` (i.e. the effective `version` for an deployable already deployed) is `CURRENT`,
which resolves to the version currently installed.
In this way you can use it to update one deployable, while all others remain the same.
This works even if you reference a variable that is not defined.
Note that this does not work for bundles, as they are not actually deployed in the container, so there's not `CURRENT` version for them.
If the checksum of an artifact is unknown in your repository, this resolution does not work and updating the `CURRENT` artifact is skipped.
To put your container into a defined state, you should `manage` the versions of _all_ artifacts, so anything unknown is either updated or removed.

The dollar-curlies syntax is used for variables and variable expressions.
You can use variables for many things, but passing in versions is probably the most common use case.

Another interesting one is the log level. Maybe you want `DEBUG` on QA, but `INFO` in production.
But it would be cumbersome to pass this to every POST request.
Gladly, you can also define variables in the `deployer.config.yaml`; just add this section:

```yaml
vars:
  default.log-level: DEBUG
```

... for the QA stage, and with `INFO` for production.

You now could use `${default.log-level}` in all your `loggers`, but this variable happens to be the default for loggers.
Only if this variable is _not_ set, it defaults to `DEBUG`.

Another thing you'll be repeating all over the place, is the `group-id`.
You can also add this to your `deployer.config.yaml`, and then remove the `group-id` throughout your configuration files.
But there's no other fallback, i.e. if you don't have this variable set, The Deployer will fail with an undefined variable error.

Not all values can be set in this way; e.g., there's no much use in defining a `default.artifact-id`, is it?
For a complete list, see the [reference](reference.md#vars).


## Configure Root Bundle

Still, something's missing.
We still need to copy the root bundle to all nodes to bootstrap or when we change a resource.
Wouldn't it be nice to have a way to deploy the root bundle itself?
Of course there is, but we'll need another level of indirection:
Create a bundle artifact with the bundle file you used as a root bundle,
and configure it in the `deployer.config.yaml`:

```yaml
root-bundle:
  group-id: org.mygroup
  artifact-id: myroot
```

After removing the `deployer.root.bundle` file from your node,
you can pass the `version` to the `POST` and The Deployer will pull the root bundle from your repository.
The `group-id` defaults to your `default.group-id`, so you often can leave this out.

So you'll only have to get the `deployer.config.yaml` to your machines, which won't change very often.

If you work in a [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) like environment (or at least mindset),
you may have a platform operations team using puppet, docker, etc. to provide your container
including The Deployer... and a _generic_ `deployer.config.yaml` file!
How do you get a specific configuration into your machine, then?
You can use the _host name_: Say you have a host `myhost.mydomain.org`;
deploy your root bundle as `artifact-id` = `myhost` and `group-id` = `mydomain.org`.
The host name is the default `artifact-id` and the domain name is the default `group-id`.
In this way, you won't have to configure _anything_ for your root bundle.

If your host names end with digits, which is a common pattern for node names in a cluster, they will be stripped,
i.e. `myhost01.mydomain.org` is mapped to a bundle `artifact-id` of `myhost`.
If your host names contain stage prefixes or suffixes like `dev`, or `qa`,
you can strip those with a regular expression:
Set the `artifact-id` for the `root-bundle` config to, e.g., `${regex(hostname(), «(.*?)(dev|qa)?\d*»)}`.
The first capturing group of the expression is used as the `artifact-id`.
To strip a prefix, you'll have to mark those groups as non-capturing with `?:`, i.e. `(?:dev|qa)?(.*?)\d*`.

## Schema Bundles

Now that you know all the parts, you should go ahead and use it for a while. 
To apply things to your own environment is not only an important step to let it sink in,
it's also critical to feel the need for the next, more advanced topic. Good bye! ;-)

Welcome back! You now probably have several application bundles that look quite similar:

```yaml
log-handlers:
  MYAPP:
    file: myapp.log
loggers:
  ${default.group-id}.myapp:
    level: DEBUG
    handler: MYAPP
deployables:
  myapp:
    version: 1.0
```

That's not too bad, you may say. There's not so much repetition. You can live with that.
And you're absolutely right... as long as you only have hand full of applications to manage.
If you have hundreds of applications, things may start to look different.
Are you really sure, all of them follow the same scheme?
What happens, if you have a central change, e.g. add a second log handler to all applications.
Things like this don't happen too often, but if they do, you wish you had started differently... without even this repetition.
But... how _can_ you?

Bundles can not only be created for one single application. By passing variables into a bundle, you can reuse them!
This type of bundles are called schema bundles, but they work technically like any other bundle does.
For example, create a bundle `apps`:

```yaml
log-handlers:
  ${toUpperCase(name)}:
    type: periodic-rotating-file
    file: logstash/${name}.log
    suffix: .yyyy-MM-dd
    format: "%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss,SSS}|%X{version}|%X{client}|%t|%X{reference}|%c|%p|%s%e%n"
loggers:
  ${group-id or default.group-id}.${name}:
    level: ${log-level or default.log-level or «DEBUG»}
    handler: ${toUpperCase(name)}
deployables:
  ${name}:
    group-id: ${group-id or default.group-id}
    artifact-id: ${artifact-id or name}
    version: ${version}
```

Note the `toUpperCase` [function](reference.md#variables) used in the variable expressions,
and the ` or ` syntax used to chain potential sub expressions... the first non-null will be picked.

You can use this bundle, as normal, but instead of passing the variables `name` and `version` to the POST request
or define them in the `deployer.config.yaml`, we'll pass them to the bundle like this:

```yaml
bundles:
  apps:
    version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
    instances:
      myapp1:
        version: 1.0
      myapp2:
        version: 2.0
```

The `instances` field is semantically a list of key value pairs, only that the key `name` is 'taken out' as an outer key,
while the other variable mappings are nested inside, e.g., containing:

```yaml
name: myapp1
version: 1.0
```
and
```yaml
name: myapp2
version: 2.0
```

In this way, we can use the `apps` schema bundles for as many applications as we like;
the `name` is enforced to be unique, and the syntax is analogous to `bundles` and `deployables`.

We could also pass the variables `log-level`, `group-id`, or `artifact-id`,
but they have defaults (i.e. they have ` or ` operators) that are good for now.

Note that the bundle version `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT` is completely independent from the version that we pass into the apps schema bundle `1.0`/`2.0`.


## Controlling Versions

You can now manage the deployment of single applications.
But often there are dependencies between multiple applications... and sometimes the effects are very subtle.
- So you'll want to have a defined and reproducible combination,
- you'll want to have all versions resolved, so you can see what the plan is,
- you'll want to be able to test that set of applications in a QA stage before you move exactly that set into production,
- you'll want to give this set of fixed versions a total version number.

You can use the standard dependency resolution tools of, e.g., Maven: Modify the `pom.xml` of your bundle like this:

1. For every application in your bundle, add a maven property, e.g. `myapp.version`.
1. For every application in your bundle, add a dependency using that version property, e.g.:

 ```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mygroup</groupId>
    <artifactId>myapp</artifactId>
    <version>${myapp.version}</version>
    <type>war</type>
</dependency>
```
3. Enable resource filtering:

```xml
<build>
    <resources>
        <resource>
            <directory>src/main/resources</directory>
            <filtering>true</filtering>
        </resource>
    </resources>
    ...
</build>
```

In this way, the variable `${myapp.version}` in your bundle will be resolved when building,
i.e. while you have the variable name in your source bundle (as we did before),
it will be the fixed version string from the pom in the deployed artifact
(and this is a double use of the variable syntax: The Deployer and Maven Resource Filtering).

Now you can use the `versions` plugin to update the versions in your pom:

`mvn versions:update-properties -DgenerateBackupPoms=false`

If you want to also update to snapshot versions, use `-DallowSnapshots` (and maybe `--update-snapshots`). 

You can also exclude or whitelist certain properties or artifacts:
see `mvn versions:help -Dgoal=update-properties -Ddetail` for details.
For details on the `rulesUri` option, see [this blog](http://blog.xebia.com/keeping-dependencies-up-to-date-in-maven/)
or the [docs](http://www.mojohaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/rule.html).

Note that when using resource filtering you'll have to be **careful** with the variable names in your bundle.
E.g., the variable `${name}` would get replaced with the name of the `artifact-id` defined in your `pom.xml`.
If this happens, you can use an expression like `${name or name}`, as this won't be resolved by Maven,
but this should not happen too often.

You may want to go the extra mile and stick to [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) even for your bundles,
i.e. changes to the version number of the bundle should reflect the biggest change contained,
e.g. when you have one deployable change from 1.3.5 to 1.3.7 and another deployable change from 2.12.1 to 2.13.5,
you'll want your bundle version 12.7.3 to change to 12.8.0.

To do so in a Jenkins pipeline build job,

1. install the [HTTP Request Plugin](http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/HTTP+Request+Plugin) to do the POST to The Deployer,
1. install the [jenkins-pipeline-updates](https://github.com/t1/jenkins-pipeline-updates)
as a [Shared Library](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-cps-global-lib-plugin/blob/master/README.md)
(`Manage Jenkins` -> `Configure System` -> `Global Pipeline Libraries`; name it `updates` and set the latest version tag of the lib)
to be able to parse the output of your `mvn versions:update-properties` (the `scan` method below), and
1. use a `Jenkinsfile` similar to this:

```groovy
#!groovy

@Library('updates') _

String mvn(args) {
    return sh(returnStdout: true, script: "${tool 'M3'}/bin/mvn ${args}")
}

node {
    stage('Checkout') {
        checkout scm
    }

    Updates updates = stage('Update') {
        scan(mvn('versions:update-properties -DgenerateBackupPoms=false'))
    }

    if (updates.isEmpty()) {
        echo 'no updates found for version ' + updates.getCurrentVersion() + '... skip rest of build job'
        return
    }

    stage('Commit') {
        echo updates.toString()
        def pom = readMavenPom file: 'pom.xml'
        pom.version = updates.updateVersion + '-SNAPSHOT'
        writeMavenPom model: pom

        sh "git add pom.xml"
        sh "git commit -m '${updates.toString()}'"
    }

    stage('Release') {
        mvn 'release:prepare release:perform --batch-mode'
    }

    stage('Push') {
        sh 'git push'
    }

    stage('Deploy') {
        deploy(updates.updateVersion, 'http://localhost:8080')
    }
}

private void deploy(String version, String host) {
    def response = httpRequest(
            httpMode: 'POST',
            url: host + '/deployer',
            acceptType: 'APPLICATION_JSON',
            contentType: 'APPLICATION_JSON',
            requestBody: '{"version":"' + version + '"}')
    echo "Content: ${response.content}"
}
```

Now you can link the release jobs of all applications contained in the bundle to this job,
so that after an application is released, the bundle containing it, too, will be released
and then deployed to, e.g., your QA stage.
This works even if you have the same application in several clusters, i.e. in several bundles;
simply link the release job to multiple bundle release-and-deploy jobs.

By adding the resource filtering to work with fixed versions, you can't use that bundle with dynamic versions any more.
But you may still want to do that for the DEV stage: Every commit should result in a deployment on DEV.
You'll need the _raw_ bundle file in addition to the bundle with all versions resolved.
To do so, add a second artifact to the `build-helper-maven-plugin` in the pom of your bundle:

```xml
<artifact>
    <file>src/main/resources/${project.artifactId}</file>
    <classifier>raw</classifier>
    <type>bundle</type>
</artifact>
```

This produces a second bundle in your repository, distinguished by the classifier `raw`,
so you can add a `root-bundle` parameter `classifier` value `raw` to your `deployer.config.yaml` on DEV to pull the raw bundle.
And by adding a `root-bundle` parameter `version` value `UNSTABLE`, you'll always have the latest version on DEV.
So it's very common for a `deployer.config.yaml` on DEV to contain this:

```yaml
root-bundle:
  classifier: raw
  version: UNSTABLE
```

If you have multiple containers running on one machine (often called slots) running different sets of applications,
you can also use the classifier, e.g.:

```yaml
root-bundle:
  classifier: slot-1
  version: UNSTABLE
```


## Security

There are other resources that you can configure with The Deployer.
For a complete list, see [the reference](reference.md#bundle-file-format).
But some resources, e.g. data sources, require credentials, most often a user name and a password.
You should *not* just put them into a bundle stored in your repository... too many people will be able to see that!

While security-wise the best alternative is to use client certificates to authenticate and authorize,
this option is often not available.
But you can instead encrypt the password and let The Deployer decrypt it with a key stored on the machine.
The encryption can be symmetric, but you'll get the most comfort/security balance by using public key encryption,
eventually even with the public key from the server certificate of the machine:

Assuming that you have a server certificate named `server-certificate` in a keystore file `~/keystores/keystore.jks`,
add this to your [config](reference.md#config):

```yaml
key-store:
  path: ~/keystores/keystore.jks
  alias: server-certificate
```

If you have configured your server to use this certificate for `https`,
you can encrypt a password (e.g. `secret`) like this:

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.github.t1.deployer.tools.CipherService/my-service.example.org secret"
```

For other options to decrypt secrets, see the `decrypt` methods in the [reference](reference.md#variables).

In the maven output, you'll see a long binhex string of the encrypted key.
Take this and paste it to the bundle containing the data source:

```yaml
data-sources:
  TestDS:
    uri: jdbc:h2:mem:test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE
    username: sa
    password: ${decrypt(«bar»)}
```

where `bar` has to be replaced with that long binhex encrypted key string.

If you need a specific key from the keystore, you can pass its alias as a second parameter to the `decrypt` method.


## Stage Specific Variables

Some values _have_ to be different on each stage.
If you have a variable `stage`, you can use a `switch` statement for that:

```yaml
data-sources:
  foo:
    password: "${switch(stage)
      dev: «A»
      qa: «B»
      prod: «C»
      }"
```

Please note that this syntax is (currently) very limited:
* You need the quotes so YAML doesn't complain about the colons,
* the closing brackets have to be on the same indent level as the case labels,
so YAML parses them to be a part of the string,
* the newlines and leading spaces are collapsed by YAML, but the placement of whitespace is important,
* the labels must be simple values, and
* the resulting values must be string literals.


You can combine this with the `decrypt` function:

```yaml
data-sources:
  foo:
    password: "${decrypt(switch(stage)
      dev: «A»
      qa: «B»
      prod: «C»
      })"
```
